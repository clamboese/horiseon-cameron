Code Refractor

The changes that were made to the initial code were made in 
order to make the the new code more readable and more accessable. 
html tags were changed in order to reflect what the intended 
purpose of that specific line of code. for example many <div> tags
 have been removed, and in their place, were replaced with new tags 
such as <nav>, <section>, <aside>. many images were given an alt 
characteristic in order to be more accessable if the image had issues 
loading for some reason.
